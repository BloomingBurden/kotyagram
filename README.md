# PHOTOGRAM
Hello everybody. Photogram - is a project where you can upload funny pictures of cats. Comment, like the most funny cats :) In fact, this is an analogue of Instagram without a personal account.

2. Sass, gulp and different and other tools were involved.
3. A bit PHP.
4. Almost full responsive.
5. Accessibility
6. Semantic
